# Waveform-mixing-with-Spectral-Forecast-in-JS



This Javascript project uses my own mathematical model published in the journal [Chaos](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5120818). The model is called Spectral Forecast. The Spectral Forecast equation is a part of the Spectral Forecast model and it was initially used on matrices. It can also be used on other multidimensional mathematical objects. Here, a novel utility is demonstrated for signals by using the equation on vectors. This new use on 1-dimensional objects was published [here](https://www.wiley.com/en-ie/Algorithms+in+Bioinformatics:+Theory+and+Implementation-p-9781119697992). <b>Waveform mixing with Spectral Forecast in JS</b> - is a demo application designed in Javascript, that is able to mix two signals (<i>A</i> and <i>B</i>) in arbitrary proportions. Different cases can be seen, with two different waveform signals that are combined depending on a value <i>d</i>, called a distance. This distance <i>d</i> is defined from zero to the maximum value found above the two vectors that represent these signals. The two HTML files (<kbd>index.html</kbd> and <kbd>waveform mixing with Spectral Forecast.html</kbd>) have the same content. The presence of the <kbd>index.html</kbd> file is required for the [live demo](https://gagniuc.github.io/Waveform-mixing-with-Spectral-Forecast-in-JS/) (Github specific).

Here's how to use the Spectral Forecast equation to combine two waveforms:
